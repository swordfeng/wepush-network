Security Protocol Design V1
========================
Handshake Steps:
  1. client connect to server with accepted cipher type, device pkey, random challenge(32 bytes now), signature
        version|accept_ciphers_len|accept_ciphers|device_key_type|device_key|client_challenge|signature
  2. server reply with chosen cipher type, server pkey, g^a, random challenge, signature(buffer|client_challenge)
        server_key_type|kex_type|AEAD_type|server_key|kex_aG|server_challenge|signature
  3. client send g^b, signature(bG|server_challenge)
        key_bG|signature
  4. now communicates with AEAD and message format:
        length(2 bytes LE)|tag(size of tag)|ciphertext(length bytes)
     nonce is counted from 0 and increased 1 for each message sent, LE
Signatures are always signatures of the whole handshake message (except itself of course) and challenge.
Server and client now share the secret g^(ab), and derive enc_key, mac_key (if present) from it
Accepted Cipher Suites:
    Kex: DHE(diffiehellman), ECDHE(pyelliptic for nist, pysodium for curve25519)
    Signature: RSA(rsa), ECDSA(ecpy), [EDDSA](ecpy or pysodium)
    AEAD: AES-GCM(pycryptodome), [CHACHA20-POLY1305](pysodium)
Assigned Cipher Types:
    0x01 DHE (2048)
    0x02 ECDHE (curve25519)
    0x41 RSA (2048)
    0x42 RSA (4096)
    0x43 EDDSA (ed25519)
    0x81 AES-GCM (256)
    0x82 CHACHA20-POLY1305 (IETF)
    0xFF Reject Ciphers
Now we only support ECDHE(curve25519)-EDDSA(ed25519)-CHACHA20-POLY1305(IETF), aka [0x02,0x43,0x82]
Currently KDF is sha512, e.g. [server_send_key|client_send_key] = sha512(shared_secret)

Communicate Protocol Design
===========================
Two modes:
    1. JSON mode, when connection setup and end of file transfer
    2. File mode, when receiving a get-file request (either server or client)
General message format:
    {
        "message": "<request-type>",
        ... other arguments
    }
General response format:
    {
        "success": true|false,
        ["error": "<error message>",] // only presents when success == false
    }
JSON must be sent in a single message
File can be split into multiple messages

Client Messages
---------------
listen
    this connection waits for server push
    no params
push
    push a notification
    params:
        content_type: mime type? <string>
        content: content of notification <string>
        target: all devices or specific device? <[string...]>
push_clipboard
    push content of clipboard
    params: (same as push?)
push_file
    push a file
    params:
        content_type: mime type? <string>
        target: all devices or specific device? <[string...]>
        filename: filename <string>
        length: file length <int>
        digest: hashsum of file <string>
    response:
        get_range: a range in the file <[int, int]>
    the client enter File Mode after a response with a get_range
    the response may repeat several times until file is complete
    until server respond without "get_range" in fields
get_file
    get a file pushed to this device
    params:
        from: device <string>
        digest: hashsum <string>
        get_range: a range in the file <[int, int]>
    server first send a response and, if success, enter File Mode
    and send the file
status
    get register status from server
    no params
    response:
        registered: true|false <boolean>
        user: username (if registered) <string>
        devices: device info (if registered) <[{"devicekey": string, "description": string}...]>
        (and other info...)
register_device
    register this device as a specific user
    params:
        username: username <string>
        password: password <string>
        description: description(displayname?) of this device <string>
    (server retrieve device pkey from connection info)
register_user
    register a new user
    params:
        username: username <string>
        password: password <string>
        description: description(displayname?) of current device <string>

Server Messages
---------------
push
    push a notification
    params:
        content_type: mime type <string>
        content: content <string>
push_clipboard
    push clipboard content
    params: same as push
push_file
    notify the client that a file is pushed
    params:
        content_type: mime <string>
        filename: filename <string>
        length: file length <int>
        digest: hash <string>
    client invoke get_file request after this message
restart_file
    make a client retransmit a file
    params:
        digest: hash <string>
    client invoke push_file request with empty target after this message
heartbeat
    keep connection alive
    no params
    must be sent every 30 seconds by server

Proposal for UDP-based stream protocol design
=============================================
Packet types, Flow Control and Congestion control is similar to uTP.
Packet format is same as uTP with an extra extension.
http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0029.html
Congestion Control:
    target offset = 25ms
An extension (extension = 0x80): Crypto Setup
    We include a security handshake buffer into extension field,
    sent within SYN-STATE-DATA handshake process.
    Buffers are padded to a multiple of 4 bytes (according to uTP specification).
[We choose not implementing this now as the deadline is rather soon.]
